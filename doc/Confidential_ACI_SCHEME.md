# Confidential ACI scheme to support verification that a container group is genuine

Confidential ACI uses [AMD SEV-SNP features](https://www.amd.com/en/support/tech-docs/sev-secure-nested-paging-firmware-abi-specification) to ensure the VM hosting running containers is secure against threats from the host operating system. The host starts a Utility VM (UVM) running a minimalist Linux in SNP mode for this purpose. 

It is essential to check that sensitive workloads are indeed running in SNP VMs. This is done by obtaining an attestation report signed by the AMD hardware and passing that to a relying party to verify. You can also verify the attestation report manually.


Thus, a container must provide evidence to the relying party such that it can decide to release sensitive information to the container.

The evidence comprises the attestation report itself and three artefacts used to check it. These are:
- Certificates issued by AMD to prove the particular CPU in the physical host is genuine and to verity the signed attestation report was generated by that CPU.
- A [COSE_Sign1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9052) document signed by the Microsoft team which is responsible for the SNP VM image containing the expected hardware measurement of the SNP Utility VM and a SVN (Security Version Number) 
- The [confidential computing enforcement policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-confidential-overview#confidential-computing-enforcement-policies), also known as security policy supplied to the container runtime within the SNP Utility VM by the ACI infrastructure. This is the security policy provided by the customer to control what can be run within the VM, for example, which containers, environment variables, command lines and so forth.

These artefacts are provided as base64 encoded files in each containerâ€™s filesystem. The path to these files is generated to avoid colliding with existing files and made available via an environment variable `UVM_SECURITY_CONTEXT_DIR` (typically `/security-context-*`). Under that path are three files:
- host-amd-cert-base64
- reference-info-base64
- security-policy-base64

## host-amd-cert-base64

These are the AMD platform certificates, as per Trusted Hardware Identity Management Document - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/trusted-hardware-identity-management#definitions, encoded to base64. As a Go data structure:

```go
// format of the JSON provided to the UVM by hcsshim. Comes from the THIM endpoint
// and is a base64 encoded JSON string
type THIMCerts struct {
    VcekCert         string `json:"vcekCert"`
    Tcbm             string `json:"tcbm"`
    CertificateChain string `json:"certificateChain"`
    CacheControl     string `json:"cacheControl"`
}
```

Example code using the struct can be found here:

https://github.com/microsoft/confidential-sidecar-containers/blob/main/pkg/common/info.go

The following is an example of decoded JSON object:

```json
{
    "vcekCert": "<PEM certificate>",
    "tcbm": "7308000000000003",
    "certificateChain": "<PEM certificate chain>",
    "cacheControl": "86400"
}
```

`tcbm` is CURRENT_TCB in Table 21 of [SEV Secure Nested Paging Firmware ABI Specification](https://www.amd.com/en/support/tech-docs/sev-secure-nested-paging-firmware-abi-specification).
`cacheControl` is an implementation detail.

## reference-info-base64

The COSE_Sign1 envelope has a JSON object as payload. It contains the SVN of Confidential ACI as x-ms-sevsnpvm-guestsvn and hex encoded launch time measurement of UVM as x-ms-sevsnpvm-launchmeasurement.

The production SVN starts from 100.
The latest SVN can be found at TODO.

The measurement the same as MEASUREMENT of attestation report in Table 21 of [SEV Secure Nested Paging Firmware ABI Specification](https://www.amd.com/en/support/tech-docs/sev-secure-nested-paging-firmware-abi-specification).

There might be more fields in the JSON in future.

The following is an example payload:
```json
{
  "x-ms-sevsnpvm-guestsvn": "100",
  "x-ms-sevsnpvm-launchmeasurement": "03fea02823189b25d0623a5c81f97c8ba4d2fbc48c914a55ce525f90454ddcec303743dac2fc013f0846912d1412f6df"
}
```

To validate the COSE_Sign1 envelop you need to unpack it to get `issuer` and `feed`.
`issuer` is a [did:x509](https://github.com/microsoft/did-x509/blob/main/specification.md) string and it can be used to check if it is properly signed by Microsoft.
The did:x509 string must match with `feed`.

These are examples that validate COSE_Sign1 envelope:
- https://github.com/microsoft/hcsshim/blob/36359c002b0df048ea65a4c7fd27d5a4ec1310c5/internal/guest/runtime/hcsv2/uvm.go#L182

In Go, [cosesign1go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Microsoft/cosesign1go) and [didx509go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Microsoft/didx509go) are available to handle COSE_Sign1 and did:x509 respectively.
In C++, [t_cose](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/t_cose) and [didx509cpp](https://github.com/microsoft/didx509cpp) are available.

## security-policy-base64

The [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) security policy is written in  by users or generated by [Microsoft Azure CLI 'confcom' Extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions/blob/main/src/confcom/azext_confcom/README.md). It is provided to the UVM at startup, and its SHA256 hash is used as HOST_DATA of attestation report. The following is an example:
